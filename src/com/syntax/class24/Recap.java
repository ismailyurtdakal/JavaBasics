	/* final keyword - non access modifier that identifies something is completed and 
	 * cannot be modified
	 * 
	 * final can be used:
	 * 1.final variables--> have constant value that cannot be changed during
	 * the program! final variables must be initialized
	 * 
	 * 2.final methods--> cannot be overridden
	 * 3.final classes: cannot have subclassess
	 * 
	 * 4 main OOPS concept in Java
	 * 
	 * ***1.Inheritance - process when child class inherits all properties and
	 * behaviors from the parent
	 * 
	 * 3 types of inheritance
	 * 1.single: parent -- child
	 * 2.multilevel: parent--child1--child2
	 * 3.hierarchial
	 * 
	 * ***2.Polymorphism - process when object can perform action in
	 * different way
	 * 
	 * 1.runtime/dynamic/late binding achieved through method overriding
	 * 2.compile time/static/early binding achieved through method overloading
	 * 
	 * ***3.Abstraction - process of hiding the implementation details and showing
	 * only functionality to the user. Process of hiding complexity from the users 
	 * and show them only the relevant information
	 * 
	 * To implement abstraction in programming(Java) we use 
	 * 1.Abstract class is a class that has abstract keyword and defined and undefined 
	 * methods
	 * 
	 * 2.Interface 
	 * 
	 * to define method without any implementations we  use abtract keyword
	 * 
	 * Abstract is a non access modifier that identifies something is INCOMPLETED. 
	 * abstract keyword can be used with methods and classes.
	 * 
	 * Abstract class(AC):
	 * AC can have abstract and non abstract methods
	 * AC can have have a constructor
	 * AC can have instance and static and static variables
	 * AC can have static method(non abstract)
	 * 
	 * abstract methods cannot be: private, static, final!
	 * 
	 * WE CANNOT CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE ABSTRACT CLASS
