/*
 * /Constructors - block of code similar to a method 
 * that is executed when object os created
 *
 *Why we need a constructro? to initialize an object
 *
 *When we do not define the cosntructor compiler will create default non argument constructor.
 *
 *If I want to create constructor
 *1.no return type(not even void)
 *2.name must be same as className
 *
 *Constructor types:
 *non argument
 *parameterized
 *
 *this keyword is used to refer to the current instance members (variables and methods)
 *this with variables:
 *
 *this is used to access instance variables
 *(we need it when local and isntance variables are same)
 *
 *static vs non static
 *static can access ONLY static members
 *static can access both static members and non static members
 *
 *this with method
 *used to call instane method within the same class
 *
 *this(); call CURRENT cass cunstructor
 *
 *this()--> ALWAYS MUST BE 	first line inside your constructor
 * 
 *
 *Main Java OOPs Concepts
 *
 *Inheritance
 *Polymorohism
 *Abstarction
 *Encapsulation
 *
 *Inheritance - mechanism/process in which object get access to all
 *atrributes(variables) and behaviors(methods) from another class
 *
 *Types of Inheritance
 *Single 
 *multilevel
 *hierarcial
 *
 *EVERY CLASS IN JAVA HAS A PARENT
