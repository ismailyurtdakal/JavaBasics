 * Abstration
 * Encapsulation-process of wrapping code and data in a single unit
 * 
 * Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables)
 *  and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
 *  In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from 
 *  other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of 
 *  their current class.
 *** From student: We  declare all the variables in the class as private 
 * and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of 
 * variables.
 * 
 * Encapsulation is a data hiding
 * 
 * To achieve encapsulation:
 * 1.make variables/fields private
 * 2.make public getters and setters to access those variables
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * To store multiple values we use arrays
 * Limitations of the array:
 * 1.Array are fixed in size
 * 2.Array do not have ready method to manipulate data(remove, replace,add etc)
 * 
 * To overcome limitations of arrays Collections concept was introduced
 * 
 * Colections will be dynamic in size
 * Collections will have ready methods to manipulate with data inside the 
 * collections we can store/use only OBJECTS
 * 
 * byte - Byte
 * short - Short
 * int - Integer
 * long -Long
 * float -Float
 * double -Double
 * boolean -Boolean
 * char -Character
 *
