/*/Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details
 * Abstraction in Java can be achieved in 2 ways:
 * 1.Abstract class
 * 2.Interface
 * 
 * Abstract class defined with abstract keyword and can have implemented and 
 * unimplemented method
 * 
 * Abstract class can have: 
 * constructor
 * instance variables
 * static variables
 * define methods(static and instance)
 * undefine methods(instance only)
 * 
 * undefined/unimplemented/method with no body/abstract method
 * they CANNOT be PRIVATE, STATIC, FINAL
 * 
 * 
 * INTERFACE
 * Interface is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
 * Interface is blueprint of the class.
 * 
 * What can we have inside the interface?
 * can we have instance variables?NO
 * can we have static variables? Yes but only final!(public static final)
 * Can we have a constructor? No
 * 
 * IN INTERFACE ALL MEMBERS WILL BE PUBLIC
 *
 *** NOTE: Since Java 8, interfaces can have static and default methods
 * 
 * Abstract Class vs Interface
 * 1.AC can have instance variables while interface cannot
 * 2.AC can have a constructor while Interfce cannot
 * 3.Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface, while interface can’t provide the implementation of abstract class.
 * 4.We can extend only 1 abstract class but can implement many interfaces
 *  (achieving multiple inheritance)
 * 
 * 5.In AC, we can use any access modifiers for variables and methods(except abstract, cannot be private)
 * while in Interface all variable are public, all abtract methods are public as well.
 * 
 * NOTE: Since Java 8, interfaces can have implemented static and default methods
 * 
 * Group HW
 * 1.Must complete tasks as a group
 * 2.Record a flipgrid video as a group:
