//OOPs in Java --> Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation	

/*What is a class in Java?	
*Class is blueprint/template
*
*Car:
*feature:model,make,color,4 wheels,engine,door
*actions:drive,accelarate, stop, break, make, naoise
*
*
*House:
*feature:rooms, kitchen, doors, bathroo, garage
*
*car1.make="lombarghini"'
*car1.model="gallardo";
*car1.door=2;
*car1.color="blue";
*
*car2.make="BMW";
*car2.model="m5";
*car2.color="pink";
*car2.door="4";
*
*car1.drive();--> lambo
*car2.makeNoise();-->BMW
*
*TV
*features:screen,color, size,brand
*actions:watch movies, play music, display images
*
*Dog:
*features:breed, color, name, age
*actions/behavior"eat, sleep, run, bark
*
*dog1.breed="Shih tzu";
*dog1.color="yellow";
*dog1.name="Lucy";
*god1.age=2;
*
*In Programming:
*
*template - is a class
*features/attributes/fields - variables
*actions/beahvior - methods
*
*Class - is a template
*Objects - instance/exmaples of the class
*
*Once we create an Object of the class/instance of the class 
*that oject will have access to all varibales and methods from that class
*
*We can create as many objects as we want
*Main Method--> is a special method and it's needed for the program execution
*
*During the execution, Java virtual machine(JVM) looks for the main method and 
*once it finds the code inside the main methid will execute TOP to BOTTOM
*
*Class without main method is NOT EXECUTABLE
*
*Methods in Java
*
*Built
*UserDefined:method that define by us/Programmers
*
*In Java we have datatypes
*Primitive:8
*Non Primitive:Objects (String, Car,Dog, Phone...)
*
*Methods in Java:
**with parameters
*and without
