 *Restrictions/disadvantages of static
 *
 *static variables - 1 copy shared among all instances. 
 *if value of static variable will be changed in one of the instances
 *

 *static method - access only static members of the class!!!
 *ex:
 *static String brand;
 *
 *static void method(){
 *..... brand can be accessible
 *
 *Instance members of the class cann access ALL STATIC members
 *}
