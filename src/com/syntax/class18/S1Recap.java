/*
 * Static keyword is a non access modifier
 *Static can be ussed with variables and methods
 *
 *Sttaic members of the class can be accessed using it's class name
 *
 *Access modifiers:
 *public -accessibility/visibility for all classess in the project
 *protected - accessibility/visibility for all classess within the same package as of now!
 *dafault - accessibility/visibility for all classess within the same package
 *private - 
 *
 *Consructor
 *Recap obj=new Recap(); ==> Recap() is a the constructor
 *Recap -- class name
 *obj -- obj ref(variable)
 *= -- assigning operator
 *Recap()--constructor
 *
 *Constructor - block of code(similar to method, special method)
 *that is executed when an Objectof the class is cerated
 *
 *Why do we need constructors?
 *Constructors initialize objects(initialstate to your object by initializing instane variables)
 *
 *When we do not create any construcotrs --> compiler creates a (default constructor) 
 *to initialize an object!
 *
 *Syntax Method
 *returnType name(){}
 *
 *Syntax for constructor
 *nameAsClasName(){}
 *
 *Rules to create a Constructor:
 *1.Name must be same as class name
 *2. No return type
 *
 *Type of Constructors:
 *
 *Non agument - (if we do not create any constructor, compiler 
 *will create 1 default non - argument constructor)
 *
 *parameterized-constructor caan have many different types of parameters
 *
 *
 *Constructors vs Methods
 *1.Contructor can have ONLY class name vs mthods can have any name
 *
 *2.Constructor does not returm anything not even void vs methods can be of void type or return some value(int, double, char, String etc)
 *
 *3. Constructor is getting called everytime we can create an object vs method
