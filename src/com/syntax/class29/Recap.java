public class Recap {
/*
* Similarities between ArrayList and LinkedList
* Both implements List interface, it means both ordered
* collections that allow duplicates and store elements based on indexes
* 
* Diffeences
* ArrayList - is good and fast for retrieving elements
* LinkedList - is for manipulation and removing elements
* 
* ArrayList and Array
* Similarities:both can hold multiple values, both can hold objects
* 
* Differences: Array is a static data structure vs ArrayList is dynamic data structure
*Array can store primitives while ArrayList cannot 
*
*Array does not have ready methods while ArrayList does
*
*Set Colletion/Interface - A Set is a Collection that can only contain unique elements.
* 
* The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and adds the restriction
* that duplicate elements are prohibited.
* 
* Implementation classes of Set Interface:
1.HashSet  ===>Does not guarantee any insertion order and allows null element.
2.LinkedHashSet===>follows insertion order of the element.
3.TreeSet  ===>follows ascending sorting order of the element no matter how they are added.
NB: All 3 classes  doesn't provide any additional method other than those found in Set Interface.
* 
*** with polymorhic way you can't access the methods of the child class unless you downcast
*
* my own Notes:
* TreeSet=> store elements in alphabetical order, BUT IT IS SLOWEST
  HashSet=>	no duplicates, no maintaining order
  LinkedHashSet==> no duplicates, but order is maintined
* 
* 3 main implementations of Set interface
* 
* 1.HashSet: Does guarantee  any insertion order and allows null element
* 2.LinkedHasSet:follows insertion order of the element
* 3.TreeSet: follows ascending sorting order of the element no matter how they are added
* 
* List vs Set?
* 1)List is an ordered collection that has duplicates elements/objects 
* while set does not allow duplicates
* 
* 2)
* List has 3 implemenetation classes:ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
* Set has 3 implementation classes:HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
* 
* How to remove duplicates elements from List? convert to set
* 
* How to retrieve single elements from Set? convert to List
* 
*Collectons is a utility class that have methods to work with arrays
*Arrays is a utility class 
*
*to sort elements of any collection
*collection is a utility class that have methods to work with collections.
*Collections.sort(list); 
*
*
*Map is an object that stores group of objects as key and value pair.
*
*Map is an interface(NOT COLLECTION)
*Key +value=Entry
*
*Map is a collection of objects
*
*Map has 4 implementation classess:
*HashMap
*LinkedHashMap
*TreeMap
*HashTable
*
*** HashMap is not maintaining the order
*** Linked is maintaining order!!
