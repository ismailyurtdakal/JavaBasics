/*Collection is acontainer object
 * 
 * Inside collection we can store objects of predefined classes:String, Integer,
 * Double, Long, Boolean etc
 * Also we can store objects of user defined classes: Yesterday we did (Flower, Car,
 * Student)
 * 
 * 3 Interfaces that extends Collection interface:
 * (know these below by heart)
 * 1)LIST- ordered collection that allows DUPLICATES. ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector 
 * 2)SET - 
 * 3)QUEUE
 * 
 * Iterator is used to iterate objects/elements in all colections 
 * it has 3 methods:
 * boolean hasNext();
 * Object next();
 * void remove();
 * 
 * Anytime we want to remove an object from Collection USE iterator
 * 
 * Array vs ArrayList
 * 1.Array is a static data structure vs ArrayList is a adynamic structure
 * 
 * 2. ArrayList cannot store primitives, array can store primitives
 * 
 * 3.Array does not have have ready methods to manipulate with data 
 * while ArrayList is a collection class and it has methods such as
 * add(); remove(); replace(); etc
 * 
 *  4. Array can be multidimentional, while ArrayList is single dimensional
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * LinkedList -  class that implements List Interface and stores elements 
 * in a form of doubly list..
 * 
 * from Ahmet 
 * ArrayList is the best option for retrieving, 
 * LinkedList is best option for adding and removing.
 *
 * Differences(Popular Interview question)
 * 1.ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. 
 * while LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
 * 
 * ArrayList is the best choice to retrive data
 * LinkedList is the best choice to perform and add remove 
 * 
 * (LinkedList is better because LinkedList provides different methods for manipulation 
 * such as. add first, add last and remove first, etc.)
 * 
 * Repl exercises,
 * Tasks
 * Set Interface no duplicate elements
 * 
 * three implementations of Set interface. How storing data is the diff between them
 * Hashset
 * LinkedHashSet
 * TreeSet
 * 
 * Map Interface VERY IMPORTANT, How to retrive, store
