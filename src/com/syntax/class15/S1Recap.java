		 * Methods in java
		 * built in - String, Scanner,println();
		 * user define- Defined by programmer
		 * 
		 * Methods in Java
		 * With parameters
		 * Without parameters
		 * 
		 * Parameters vs Arguments
		 * 
		 * When we create a method we specify parameters that method accepts
		 * 
		 * When we call/execute the method we pass values/arguments
		 * 
		 * 23 - argument
		 * obj.evenOrOdd(23);
		 * 
		 * Methods in Java:
		 * 
		 * methods that return a value
		 * methods that does not return any value
		 * 
		 * If we want to execute a method:
		 * 1.We need to create an object of the class to which that method belogs
		 * 2.Only after that we can call method by passing valid number or 
		 * sequencen of arguments 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * To make a method to return value we have to use return keywaord inside method body
		 * and
