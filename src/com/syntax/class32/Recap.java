/* To handle file in Java(import data or read/write file) we can use
 * 2 classes:
 * FileInputStream to import data
 * FileOutputStream to expert data
 *
 *  Using these classes we can read any type of files
 *  .txt files, .properties files, .xlsx files etc...
 *  
 *  Properties file - is file that has .properties extension and it stores data
 *  in form of key and value
 * 
 * Why do we need it?
 * Property file mostly used to store configuration settings.
 * We can make changes in the file without affecting source code
 * browser=chrome
 * url=https://
 * username
 * password=Admin123
 * dbUrl
 * dbUserName
 * dbPassword
 * 
 * driver.get(urlName);
 * 
 * driver.get(read url from propfile);
 * driver.findElement(By.id('')).sendKeys(read password from propfile);
 * 
 * To read/work with data from properties file we need properties class
 *
